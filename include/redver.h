    @brief Macros for version numbers, build number, and product information.

    RED_VERSION_SUFFIX, if defined, is a custom string that will be suffixed to
    the version number in the sign-on, replacing the build number.  It should
    only be defined by Tuxera when building a binary delivery: it should not be
    defined when building an SDK.  Since binary deliveries are always
    commercially licensed, defining RED_VERSION_SUFFIX also changes the default
    RED_KIT value.
