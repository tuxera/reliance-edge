README for the Reliance Edge configuration tool source code project

Project
-------

The configuration tool is a Qt project, built in Qt Creator 3, open source
edition. The compiled executable for Windows may be downloaded from
http://www.datalight.com/reliance-edge.

Building
========

The configuration tool is designed for Windows and Linux.  The build processes
described here have been tested Ubuntu 16.10.

The most basic thing you will need is a C++ compiler. To install it just run:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install gcc-4.8 g++-4.8
    
Next, you will need the Qt Creator package. To install Qt just run:

    sudo apt-get install qtcreator qt5-default

Once Qt Creator and a C++ compiler are both installed, open the file
redconfig.pro in Qt Creator.  You may need to set up the compiler, Qt version,
and build kit before installing.  These can be found in Tools -> Options ->
Build & Run.

To build the tool, select Build -> Build All, or just click the green play
button in the lower left-hand corner.

Running
=======

Just run the "redconfig" executable generated by the build.
