README for the Reliance Edge configuration tool source code project

Project
-------

The configuration tool is a Qt project, built in Qt Creator 3, open source
edition. The compiled executable for Windows may be downloaded from
http://www.datalight.com/reliance-edge.

Building
========

The configuration tool is designed for Windows and Linux.  The build processes
described here have been tested on Windows 7 and on Ubuntu 12.04, respectively.

The most basic thing you will need is a C++ compiler.  On Windows, you can
obtain one by downloading and installing a free version of Visual Studio, such
as Visual Studio Community Edition (see visualstudio.com).  Versions older than
2010 may not be compatible.  On Ubuntu, you can use GCC; however, you will need
to install GCC 4.8 to compile without errors.  This can be done from the
console:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install gcc-4.8 g++-4.8
    
Next, you will need the Qt Creator package.  This can be downloaded from
www.qt.io/download-open-source/.  If you already have an older version of Qt
Creator installed, you may have to upgrade your Qt packages to version 5.x.

Once Qt Creator and a C++ compiler are both installed, open the file
redconfig.pro in Qt Creator.  You may need to set up the compiler, Qt version,
and build kit before installing.  These can be found in Tools -> Options ->
Build & Run.

To build the tool, select Build -> Build All, or just click the green play
button in the lower left-hand corner.

Running
=======

The executable generated by the build process relies on dynamic linking to
several libraries in order to run.  On Windows, unless the tool is started from
Qt Creator, the following files must be included in the same folder as the
executable:

    icudt53.dll
    icuin53.dll
    icuuc53.dll
    Qt5Core.dll
    Qt5Gui.dll
    Qt5Widgets.dll
    platforms/qwindows.dll

In a standard Qt installation, these files should be found in Qt's bin
directory, except qwindows.dll, which is found in the plugins directory.  The
ICU DLL files are not needed if Qt was compiled with the option -no-icu.
